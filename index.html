          Greetings! I'm a 28-year-old web developer from Germany. I started my journey into the world of technology and
          engineering with an apprenticeship as a car mechanic. Eager to explore the intersection of engineering and
          innovation, I pursued a Bachelors degree in Motorsport Engineering and proudly graduated as one of the top
          students at my university (1.4 GPA in the german system). My career then led me into the automotive industry,
          where I delved into the fascinating world of simulation models for Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems. While I
          thrived in this dynamic environment, my passion for creativity and problem-solving beckoned me towards a new
          horizon. Recently, I embarked on an exciting adventureâ€”relocating to Bangkok, Thailand. Here, I made a bold
          decision to leave behind my role in the automotive world to pursue a career in Web Development. I'm driven by
          the boundless possibilities of programming and the opportunity to craft digital experiences that leave a
          lasting impact. Web Development has become my canvas, allowing me to blend my technical expertise with my
          creativity. I'm on a journey to master the art of web development, and I couldn't be more thrilled about the
          path ahead. Join me as I explore the ever-evolving world of technology and design, one code snippet at a time.
